# SCT_DS_1

In Task 1 of the SkillCraft Technology Data Science Internship, I explored a global population dataset using Python. I cleaned the data by removing unnecessary rows, handled missing values, and performed basic exploratory data analysis.

Finally, I created visualizations to highlight key population trends, including:

- A histogram showing total population distribution across years  
- A bar chart showing population growth from 1960 to 2004  
- Bar charts for the top 10 most and least populated countries in 2024
